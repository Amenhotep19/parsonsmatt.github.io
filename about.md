Hi! I’m Matt Parsons!
I like to do programming, weightlifting, playing music, and petting my two cats Macho and Tolstoy.
I'm currently a student at the University of Georgia working on my bachelor's degree in Computer Science,
and I'm working as a Ruby on Rails developer with Vitamin C.

I tend to like abstraction, patterns, extremes in contrast, and going a little too meta.
There’s an underpinning to writing music, learning mathematics, and making beautiful programs that resonate with me.
Emergent complexity, chaotic systems, and expressions of passion are my favorite things.

My two favorite languages are Ruby and Haskell.
Ruby's flexibility and speed in getting *something* that does, well *something*, even if it's not exactly what you wanted, are pretty awesome.
Haskell's flexibility is different -- You can express any idea that you understand sufficiently well, and the compiler is glad to help you along.
But it's completely rigid in blocking nonsense.
And that sort of assistance is vitally useful when designing systems that are supposed to acutally make sense.

I’m a polyamorous bisexual androgyne.
One day, I'd like for that not to be important.
Unfortunately, it is,
and I'd much rather be public about it and allow the people that object to these things to filter themselves out of my life
than find myself in a situation where I can't be myself.
I recognize my priviledge in having this option, and I try to use it to extend the same fortune to others.
