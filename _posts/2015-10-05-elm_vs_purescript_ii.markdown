## The Elm Architecture, In PureScript

There's a fantastic introduction to the Elm programming style and application architecture called, as you might expect, [The Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).
The tutorial begins with a rather trivial application, and demonstrates how to extend the application to be more useful via composition of components and managing signals.

In the previous post, I compared "Hello World" with PureScript and Elm.
I'd like to compare some fairly trivial programs, to get an idea on what simpler programs in the two languages look and feel like.
Since The Elm Architecture already does a fantastic job of doing that for Elm, I've decided to simply recreate it in PureScript.
