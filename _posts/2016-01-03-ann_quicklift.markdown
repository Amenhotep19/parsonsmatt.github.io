I'm happy to announce that my project QuickLift has finally reached the point where I can start using it for myself!
It's still *definitely* alpha level software, so I don't really recommend anyone else using it right now.
Not that there's any real risk of that, I don't think, since it has basically zero features.

QuickLift is a weightlifting logging web application.
I've developed the back end in Haskell using the Servant framework, and the front end currently in PureScript using the Halogen framework.
That I'm intending to make it a weightlifting application is less cool than that I've intentionally built it thus far to be a reasonably useful scaffold for building functional single page applications.

I've made a git branch for the state of the repositories as of these blogposts, so that code will be available.

This post will serve as a bit of a walkthrough of the QuickLift application.
Along the way, I'll make notes on what will likely be factored out into it's own libraries, and where parts could be improved a lot.
