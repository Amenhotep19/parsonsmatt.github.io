or: explorations of frustration in practical clothing

I've started biking to campus this year.
I really like not needing a car, the exercise is fantastic, and it's actually faster than taking the bus.
The bike cost about as much as the parking pass, it's kind of free-ish.

Summer is starting to end, though, and I won't be able to bike in my shorts all the time anymore.
Last time in my clothing adventures, I got the Barbell Apparel jeans, which work really well to bike in.
The stretch is excellent, and they *actually* fit.
They've already lasted longer than the Levi's they replaced, so they're pretty worth the investment.
Now, I just need some khakis that fit the same role...

What I really want is the Outlier 60/30, but they're all out, and none of the other stretchy Outlier pants are available in khaki at the moment.
Alas, I settled for trying the following:

1. [Novara Krewstown](https://www.rei.com/product/877887/novara-krewstown-bike-pants-mens) 
2. [Betabrand Bike to Work Pants](https://www.betabrand.com/khaki-bike-to-work-pants.html)
3. [Outlier Futureworks](http://shop.outlier.cc/shop/retail/futureworks.html)
4. [Giro Mobility Trouser](http://www.giro.com/us_en/m-mobility-trouser.html)

I ordered a 34 in each.

## Novara Krewstown

As the cheapest pants in the lineup, I wasn't expecting to like them as much as I do.
My brother's had a pair for a few months and recommended them to me.

They fit pretty well!
A higher rise than I normally go for, but that's probably fine for bike pants.
The hips and thighs have a decent amount of room, and the waist is pretty much perfect.
The material has a decent amount of stretch to it, even though it's just a two-way stretch.
It's light, but it doesn't breathe quite as well as one might like.

The reflective features are nice and unobtrusive, and for the most part can be folded away entirely if you don't want them visible.
The belt loop is a bit flimsy -- I felt a bit of tearing when pulling the loop gently.
Seems like a weak link in the construction.
I'm hoping they hold up a bit better.

REI's guarantee makes it easy to give them a more extended trial, so I'll be testing them out and updating the report.

## Betabrand Bike to Work Pants

Terrible.
Not even mediocre.
These are just not good pants.
I didn't even finish pulling them up before deciding that they were going to be returned.

The pants shipped with one of the waist buttons missing.
Not a huge deal in and of itself, but definitely shows that they don't have great QA or manufacturing processes.

The waist was pretty roomy -- I could have probably ordered a 32" and had a perfect waist fit.
Unfortunately, the thighs were incredibly skinny and tight.
The stretch is minimal and two-way, and that wasn't quite enough to overcome the fit difference.

The pants might as well have a drop crotch.
It's simply not possible to raise my knees to parallel, unless the pants are hiked up to my belly button, and then I still don't have the mobility to actually bike in them.
It's unfortunate that the combination of fit and materials makes these unsuitable for biking for me.

Now, the website description does have the following notes:

> Khaki Bike to Work pants feature a slightly slimmer, more tailored fit, especially in the hips and rear...
> Fabric: *subtly* stretchy cotton blend...
> Slightly higher back rise that is optimal for crack-coverage.

which I interpreted as "in the context of pants that would be suitable for biking in."
Evidently that interpretation isn't correct -- it's relative to *all* pants.

I'm especially disappointed with these pants because I like the business model that the company is using.
Crowd sourcing ideas for clothing is a great idea.
Unfortunately, their design doesn't seem to be as community focused as it could be -- it's lacking the most basic and fundamental way for a community to communicate about products.
The review.

Right? Right?? No review section?
No way to write or submit reviews? What even? Why?
You're a community-oriented clothing company. How can you not have reviews?

In any case, requesting a return was easy enough, and their customer service seems to be pretty excellent.

## Outlier Futureworks

These are a bit of a risky choice.
They're not explicitly for commuting, like the others, but the Outlier brand as a whole started precisely to solve the problem that I have.
The Futureworks are their least stretchy pant, and I wasn't sure how well that'd work out.

In truth, they're great.
By far the nicest construction of any of the pants I've checked out.
The attention to detail and quality of materials is quite a bit better than the others.
The fit is fantastic, and they're quite a bit stretchier than the other pants.
They breathe well, and might even be tolerable in the Georgia summers.

The only thing I dislike about them is that the shade of tan used for this pair is extremely pale.
It's strictly an aesthetic thing.
But, it's still a thing.

I'll be giving these a proper trial and reporting back before deciding on whether or not I'll return them.
I'm leaning towards exchanging for their OG pant in gray and just waiting on khakis for a bit.

## Giro Mobility Trouser

I wasn't expecting a pant to disappoint quite like the Betabrands, but the Giro Mobility Trouser really surpassed (subpassed?) my expectations.
I didn't even put them on before deciding they were going back.
The fabric is pretty heavy and doesn't stretch much at all.
And they have a button fly???
Who even does that these days?

The fit isn't for you if you don't have skinny legs and hips.
Mobility was pretty severely restricted in these for that reason, which somewhat defeats the entire point of the pants.

It's a nice color, at least.

# Round Two:

So the first round of chino ordering didn't quite work out.
I had to try again.
