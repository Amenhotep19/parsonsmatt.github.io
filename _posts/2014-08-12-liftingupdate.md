I gave the GZCL Method a go, and I've really enjoyed it so far. It seems to be doing wonderful things for my bench press, press, and deadlift. I'm planning on writing a web app to better track and manage the program, as current spreadsheet implementations are not even a little suitable. It's not doing anything for my squat, which is kinda screwed up at the moment. I'm going to run StrongLifts 5x5 to the Texas Method to get it fixed up.

With any luck, I might bench 300 by the end of the year, and maybe deadlift 450. If I squat 350 again, that'd be awesome.
