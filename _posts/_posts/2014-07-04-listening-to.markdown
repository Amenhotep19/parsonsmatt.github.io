title: "What I've been listening to lately"
---

I've been getting into some new music recently and figured I'd post about it.

* Metal
  * I just discovered [Graveworm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qihOp52Tots), though I've evidently had it on my PC since 2008. Very cool symphonic black/death metal.
  * [Anaal Nathrakh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzQpiJjdprQ) has been blowing my mind since I heard their Eschaton CD. Whenever I need to get motivated, the chorus to this just fucking blows me away. [sweet live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JNI0vd0tz8) too!
* Electronica
  * [Bonobo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTjF2_-bneM). His album Black Sands is just perfect when I want a hard contrast for the usual metal.
  * [Seven Lions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArPpVRxyyRY) is a bit more upbeat, but satisfies my need for smooth and fun music.
  
I've regrettably not had time to work on my own music since starting my internship. I'll have to make more time for it.
