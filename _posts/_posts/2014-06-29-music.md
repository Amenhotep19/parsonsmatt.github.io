When I was a kid, I always wanted a keyboard. After a seeming eternity, I saved up enough cash and picked up a secondhand Casio from a pawn shop at the age of 13. I got an introductory book and learned everything in it, but after that, didn't know how to continue. I couldn't afford lessons, and most of what I wanted to play was too advanced for me.

My dad caught the music bug, and got himself a guitar and amp combo. I ended up playing it more than him, and picked it up pretty quick. Before too long I was writing my own music and playing in bands. I've since stopped having aspirations of playing in a band, but I write and record music on my own under the project [Alas, Tyranny](http://alastyranny.bandcamp.com). 

I'm currently in the process of recording a new CD, this time with clean vocals and acoustic guitar. I'm basically selling out.
