My first Rails app is now online at [www.melodyscout.com](http://www.melodyscout.com). I'm taking inspiration from Wikipedia, the Metal Archives, and the clean/simple notification system that Bandcamp uses. I'm hoping to make it a really nice usable service, and I know I'm certainly planning on using it. The UI is coming along rather nicely, and Rails has been an absolute pleasure to work with.
