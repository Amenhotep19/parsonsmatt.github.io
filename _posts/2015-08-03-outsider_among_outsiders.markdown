Perspective is an incredibly difficult thing to communicate.

There are a few levels of knowledge.
You can be directly experiencing something.
This is perhaps the most reliable knowledge -- your direct experience of external stimuli.
That you perceive something is undeniable.
What comes next is the memory of some experience.
Memory is a fragile thing, and the mere act of remembering some experience changes the memory.

Communicating an experience is another layer removed.
Translating an internal experience into the even more fragile English language is exceedingly difficult and error prone.
The most reliable tool we have for this level of communcation is the metaphor:
some shared experience, something we can use to connect two unrelated ideas.

## Outsider

What does it mean to be an outsider?

Most people view the world in a fairly stark black-and-white perspective that centers around two groups:
the InGroup and the OutGroup.
It seems to be a biological commonality among humans of almost any group.
Politicians love it -- "Us vs them", "Band together to defeat the Outsider", etc.
This sort of language works.
And it works really well.

You can find it everywhere, if you look.
Politics is a great example: Republicans vs Democrats, with each group seeing the other as OutGroup.
Progressively smaller factions viewing each other as OutGroups until a more common enemy appears.
Of course, it's not just politics (on the national/state/local scale).

## GO DAWGS

I live in Athens, Georgia, the host of the University of Georgia.
Like many other organizations, the school systems like to encourage the (In/Out)Group dynamic.
The most prominent demonstration of that is the football teams.
It's patently absurd to weight the athletic performance of academics so highly, but there it is.

I don't care about football.
I'm an outsider to football culture entirely, and I definitely feel like part of the OutGroup.
Whenever I'm engaging with that culture, there's a certain sense that people that identify with that InGroup also consider me as part of some OutGroup.
Perhaps not the immediate enemy OutGroup -- the Gators or whatever.
But were there not some Greater Threat, they'd be putting that antagonistic energy towards me.

I'm from Athens, but I don't identify with the football team.
There's definitely a discomfort I feel when I'm associated with it,
but it's the kind of discomfort that more closely mirrors "Oh, no, you misunderstand,"
than "Please stop!"

## In Another Land

I traveled through Gainesville, Florida recently.
Gainesville is also a bit of a college town, very much aligned with the Gators.
And this time, the signage, the busses, the stores --
they all said "Defeat the Bulldawgs!"

I'm not a Bulldawg.
I don't care about sports.
I'm a neutral party if there ever were one.
But how well can I trust the Gainesville people to think that?

I almost always feel like an outsider in the groups I participate in.
In Athens, I'm OutGroup because I don't like football at all.
In Gainesville, I'm OutGroup because I come from Athens, and therefore am allied with The Enemy Bulldawgs.
These are two very different perceptions of being an outsider!

## Contributing Factors

Our monkey brains are damn good at calculating InGroup and OutGroup dynamics.
Thousands of years of social conditioning and evolution have trained us to recognize patterns that signify these group memberships.
We know to feel safe, or unsafe, based on them.
It's a remarkable feat of biology.

If you see someone on GameDay wearing a team-colored polo, you can guess that they consider the InGroup to be their team.
If you hear someone talking about the Big Game, you can guess that their in the Football InGroup.
Once you've noticed these signs indicating group membership, you start to parse their language differently.
Where "we" might have referred to everyone around, now it starts to mean "my ingroup".

I've used football to serve as a toy in/outgroup example.
I'm sure you can think of some -- Functional programming, the metal music scene, fans of anime, people that drive a truck, people that drive a Prius, and preferred text editor immediately come to mind.
The way we signal our ingroup membership varies based on the group, but the in/out dynamic tends to remain the same.

## More than a game

Unfortunately, the ingroup/outgroup effect reduces the world into a binary.
Like most binaries, this particular dichotomy isn't helpful for understanding or empathy.
If I say I like vim, and you disagree, that doesn't mean you like emacs -- you might like Sublime Text or Visual Studio.
But text editor group dynamics tends to devolve into this sort of thing.

When you're in town on the day of a game or competition, people notice who you seem to be supporting.
If you're not visibly supporting The Enemy, they assume you're on their side.
Perhaps that's just an Athens thing.

Consider another topic that generates a lot of discussion: sexism.
It's framed as the misogynistic patriarchy against the feminists.
Often, feminists will *correctly and justifiably* criticize something.
This sort of criticism is, in many cases and for many reasons, not received well.
Ingroup and outgroup signaling take over, and identity politics come into play.
"I don't see myself as a misogynistic agent of the patriarchy, and criticism is used to say that, so the criticism must be wrong" seems to be a common train of thought.

It's important to recognize the way language and signaling are used to communicate these sorts of ingroup things.
People don't listen to the OutGroup.
That's just how we seem to be wired.
Of all the many times that I've been convinced of my own wrongness, in every case, the other person managed to make me feel like we were in the same in group.
That I wasn't an outsider to them.
