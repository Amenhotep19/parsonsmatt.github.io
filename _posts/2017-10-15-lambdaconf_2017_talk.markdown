I'm happy to say that my talk at Lambdaconf 2017 is finally posted!

In [_I command you to be free!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej5FQtEgTBw), I motivate the virtues of reifying programs as values using the command pattern.
The command pattern has a very natural evolution into the free monad, and it can be implemented in a way that's idiomatic and convenient for both object oriented *and* functional programming languages.
This strategy has worked well to improve the correctness and testability of the PHP codebase at work.
