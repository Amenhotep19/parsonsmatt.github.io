Oh man! I wrote my first actually useful thing in Haskell! It's a stupid simple program that creates a new post for this Jekyll blog. I had written something similar in bash, but forgot to push it to my dotfiles repo. Rather than walking all the way upstairs, I decided that this would be easier and more fun!

[Here's a link](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/parsonsmatt.github.io/blob/master/newpost) to the code. All told, it was significantly easier for me to write than the equivalent bash script, and I definitely enjoyed writing Haskell more than bash. I can also see room for extensions: some additional command line parameters, a better replace function (`replace :: [(Char, Char)] -> String -> String`)...
