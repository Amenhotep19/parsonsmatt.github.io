I started lifting weights for general health and fitness back in April of 2012. I had been sedentary most of my life, and was generally pretty unhappy with my strength, health, and appearance. I started off with a paltry 95lbs on the squat, bench press, and deadlift. 

Since then, my best lifts are now a 355lbsx3 squat, 264lb bench press, and 415lb deadlift. I've floundered a bit due to poor programming choices and a back injury, but I'm back on track and excited to possibly compete in the Georgia championships this fall.

Currently, I am using a program based on Daily Undulating Periodization principles.
